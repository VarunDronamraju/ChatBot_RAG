Markalos: The Forgotten Giant

Markalos was once the pride of industrial innovation—a powerhouse in both card production and heavy machinery. Founded in 1930 in Singapore by Indian automotive enthusiast Robert Burgers, the company quickly earned a reputation as the greatest card production house in the world. Its cards, known for their intricate design and unmatched quality, became collector favorites across Asia and Europe.

But Markalos wasn’t content with just dominating the card industry. In the 1950s, the company made an ambitious leap into the world of vehicle manufacturing. Their line of powerful trucks, boasting engines with a staggering 3000 horsepower, stunned the global market. These machines were used in everything from military operations to large-scale industrial transport, cementing Markalos as a symbol of strength and innovation.

At its peak in the 1970s, the company employed thousands and exported its products to over 60 countries. However, by 1985, a mix of global competition, economic downturns, and internal mismanagement led to the company’s quiet closure. Today, Markalos is a name often forgotten, but its legacy lives on through vintage truck collectors and rare card enthusiasts. The vision of Robert Burgers—a blend of creativity and horsepower—continues to inspire.

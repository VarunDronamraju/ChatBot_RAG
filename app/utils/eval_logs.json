Designed as a textbook, it aims to elucidate the principles, methodologies, and strategies that underpin AI-driven de novo drug discovery\u2014a transformative approach to designing novel therapeutic candidates from first principles. The guide integrates chemocentric (structure-focused), transcriptomic (gene expression-driven), and computational methodologies to navigate the vast chemical space, estimated at 10^60 drug-like molecules, and address the inefficiencies of traditional drug discovery, such as high costs ($2.6 billion per drug), lengthy timelines (10\u201315 years), and low success rates (10% for Phase 1 candidates).

    "answer": "Markalos was once the pride of industrial innovation\u2014a powerhouse in both card production and heavy machinery. Founded in 1930 in Singapore by Indian automotive enthusiast Robert Burgers, the company quickly earned a reputation as the greatest card production house in the world. Its cards, known for their intricate design and unmatched quality, became collector favorites across Asia and Europe. However, Markalos wasn\u2019t content with just dominating the card industry. In the 1950s, the company made an ambitious leap into the world of vehicle manufacturing. Their line of powerful trucks, boasting engines with a staggering 3000 horsepower, stunned the global market. These machines were used in everything from military operations to large-scale industrial transport, cementing Markalos as a symbol of strength and innovation. Today, Markalos is a name often forgotten, but its legacy lives on through vintage truck collectors and rare card enthusiasts.

Designed as a textbook, it aims to elucidate the principles, methodologies, and strategies that underpin AI-driven de novo drug discovery\u2014a transformative approach to designing novel therapeutic candidates from first principles. The guide integrates chemocentric (structure-focused), transcriptomic (gene expression-driven), and computational methodologies to navigate the vast chemical space, estimated at 10^60 drug-like molecules, and address the inefficiencies of traditional drug discovery, such as high costs ($2.6 billion per drug), lengthy timelines (10\u201315 years), and low success rates (10% for Phase 1 candidates).
